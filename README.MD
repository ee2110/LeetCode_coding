# LeetCode Challenge and Practice

This repository is gathering all the code files and questions found in LeetCode for future revision purpose.

## Note
<ol>
<li>
When doing the test, all the code is written based on what I have in my mind and without googling for tips or answer.
The main objective is to evaluate myself in applying the coding skill. Only in the case that my answer was rejected, I will search for proper documentation to correct my understanding.
</li>
<li>
Most of solution is completed based on standard python function without using any other external python libraries such as Numpy or Pandas. Unless the question mentioned require certain library.
