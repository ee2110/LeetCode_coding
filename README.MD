# LeetCode Challenge and Practice

This repository is gathering all the code files and questions found in LeetCode for future revision purpose.

## Note
When doing the test, all the code is written based on what I have in my mind and no googling for tips or answer.
The main objective is to evaluate myself in applying the coding skill.
